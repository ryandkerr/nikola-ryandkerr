<p>Hi, I'm Ryan.</p>
<p>I'm a Junior Computer Science and Statistics concentrator at Harvard. I love all things programming, especially those involved with data analysis and visualization. Outside of intellectual pursuits I am interested in ultimate frisbee, basketball and hiking.</p>
<p>This is my personal website to showcase my projects and express my thoughts. I also plan to <a href="/../posts/docendo-discimus.html">teach</a> new techniques and technologies that I learn. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ryan.kerr.904">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=356199467">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
